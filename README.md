# GUI-Architectures

## Purpose
1. The primary purpose of this repo is to provide a handy reference for GUI architectures.
2. In doing so, the repo attempts to provide a widely-accepted/authoritative definition of terms.
3. Instead of providing simplistic examples that make any architecture seem like it can solve all problems, the repo will attempt to host real-life problems that people have had a hard time solving.
